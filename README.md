## Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life done in React and Redux. In order to calculate the state succession, the life board is represented as a 2D array and iterated through at regular intervals. The app renders to an HTML Canvas element because of the performance gains it offers over representing everything in the DOM.

Works for current versions of Chrome and Safari.
